1A,Study Objective and Scope,"Prior to the designing other aspects of an NTA study, it is important for non-targeted analysis researchers to first examine their study’s objectives and scope. Specific decisions regarding the study objectives and scope will impact sampling design, controls, and performance metrics (among other aspects). For more information regarding this section, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/study-design/#objectives-and-scope"
2A,Sample Information,"Describe the samples and sampling design, including the use of replicates, availability of blanks and QC samples, and a plan for storing sampling metadata. For more general information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/study-design/#sample-info-and-prep "
2B,Sample Preparation,"Define all sample preparation method parameters for the study. Describe any need for parameter optimization and whether the selected method is appropriate for the chemicals of interest in the study. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/study-design/#sample-info-and-prep "
3A,"Standards, Calibrants, Replicates, Blanks, QC Spikes, & QC Samples","Detail all analytical standards, calibrants, replication, blanks, QC spikes, and QC samples that will be used in the study. The tables below are intended to walk stepwise through the relevant information. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/study-design/#sample-info-and-prep and https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/study-design/#qc-spikes-and-samples."
4A,Analytical Sequence and Batches,"Determine the structure of the analytical sequence including randomization, quality control frequency, and sample replication. Identify if the study will use a single analytical batch or multiple batches, and how data from multiple batches will be combined. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/data-acquisition/#analytical-sequence "
4B,Chromatography,"During study design, it is important to define all chromatography method parameters for the study and identify any parameters that may need to be adjusted prior to the study. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/data-acquisition/#chromatography  "
4C,Mass Spectrometry,"During study design, it is important to define all mass spectrometry method parameters for the study and identify any parameters that may need to be adjusted prior to the study. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/data-acquisition/#mass-spec"
4D,System Suitability,"System suitability covers a set of materials and procedures intended to verify the performance of an instrumental method . In laymen’s terms, system suitability is a check to see if the system is working. It is important to include system suitability checks prior to, and potentially during and after, an analytical sequence to verify that the instrument will produce high quality data."
5A,Software,"For most non-targeted analysis workflows, one or more software or code-based tools are used to perform processing, statistical/chemometric analyses, annotation/identification of chemicals, and quantitative NTA. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/data-processing-and-analysis/#data-processing "
5B,Data Processing Workflow,"Describe the data conversion, extraction, reduction, and normalization steps used to isolate features of interest prior to further data analysis. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/data-processing-and-analysis/#data-processing."
5C,Statistical & Chemometric Analysis Workflow,"Determine the statistical or chemometric analyses and associated parameters. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/data-processing-and-analysis/#statistical-analysis "
5D,Annotation & Identification Workflow,"Annotation and identification workflows are essential to translating analytical data into meaningful elemental formulas, chemical classes, and/or chemical structures and identifications. Describe the protocols by which features are annotated or identified after data processing. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/methods/data-processing-and-analysis/#annotation-and-id "
5E,qNTA  Workflow,"Quantitative non-targeted analysis (qNTA) is an emerging area of NTA studies for which unknown chemicals are not only identified, but estimates for quantity (i.e., concentration) in the sample are provided. This can be done concurrent with the study or in the future (retrospectively). In order to produce data that can be analyzed quantitatively, there are specific considerations that should be made beforehand."
5F,Data Management Plan,"Proper management of the raw, processed, and analyzed data for this study will enable researchers to adequately use and share the data, as well as enable the use of the data in future (retrospective) analyses. It is important to define types of data that will be generated and how data will be collected, stored, and shared."
6A,QA/QC  ,"Quality assurance and quality control is essential to evaluate the method performance and to ensure study results data are trustworthy and appropriate for use in decision-making. For more information, go to: https://nontargetedanalysis.org/reference-content/results/qa-qc-metrics/. "
